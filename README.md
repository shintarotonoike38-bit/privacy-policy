## About This App
This application ("eBay Store SNS") uses the Pinterest API to publish 
pins featuring our eBay vintage clothing store products and retrieve 
pin analytics (impressions, clicks, saves) to measure marketing performance.

## Data Collection
- We only access Pinterest account data necessary to publish pins and 
  retrieve analytics for our own account.
- We do not store Pinterest API data beyond campaign analytics for our account.
- We call the API each time data access is needed, rather than caching data.

## Data Sharing
- We do not sell, share, or provide Pinterest data to any third parties, 
  advertising services, or data brokers.
- We do not use Pinterest data for audience targeting outside Pinterest.

## User Consent
- All actions on Pinterest (pin creation, scheduling) are explicitly 
  initiated and approved by the account owner.
- No automated bulk actions are performed without individual review.

## Children's Privacy
- This application is not directed at children under 13 years of age.
